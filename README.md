INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING

This project focuses on building an intrusion detection system using deep learning techniques implemented in Python. The system includes data preprocessing, training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and detecting intrusions in network traffic data.

OVERVIEW

Intrusion detection is crucial for identifying and preventing malicious activities in computer networks. Traditional intrusion detection systems often rely on signature-based methods, which may not be effective against unknown or zero-day attacks. This project utilizes deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop an intrusion detection system capable of learning and detecting complex patterns in network traffic data.

FEATURES

•	Data Preprocessing: Network traffic data is preprocessed to extract relevant features and prepare it for training the CNN model.

•	Trained CNN Model: A CNN model is trained using the preprocessed data to learn patterns indicative of normal and malicious network traffic.

•	Intrusion Detection: The trained CNN model is used to detect intrusions in real-time network traffic data, enabling timely responses to potential security threats.

USAGE

•	Data Preprocessing: Use the Pre_processing.ipynb notebook to preprocess the network traffic data.

•	Training the CNN Model: Train the CNN model using the CNN.ipynb notebook.

•	Intrusion Detection: Implement the trained CNN model in your network infrastructure to detect intrusions in real-time network traffic.

REQUIREMENTS

•	Python 3.x

•	Jupyter Notebook

•	TensorFlow

•	Keras

•	Other necessary libraries for data preprocessing and model training

DATASET

The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data captured from a variety of sources. Due to privacy and security concerns, the dataset is not provided here. However, you can use publicly available network traffic datasets or collect your own dataset for similar analysis.
